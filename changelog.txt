v1.2.1:
----------
I realized that I incremented the version number incorrectly after the last version. Sadly, I'm now stuck with it. Now with that out of the way...

1. Added an option to avoid using space on the first and last characters in the password.
2. Added a simple "Help" MsgBox which lists the hotkeys that can be used.

v1.2.0:
----------
1. Fixed a very minor glitch.
2. Included an "Exclude All" button on the specials form.
3. Pressing F5 or the Generate button now resets the timer if it is enabled.

v1.1.0.1:
----------
1. Added a "Website..." menu item.
2. Minor cosmetic changes.
3. Minor code changes.

v1.1.0:
----------
1. I found out that the password length for VeraCrypt increased to 128 characters, so PIM has now been extended to passwords that are 128 characters;
     however, added an override option to limit PIM usage to 64 character passwords.
2. Added an override option to drop the default PIM to 92 characters for those that use sha512/Whirlpool in VeraCrypt.
3. Fixed a bug in the override form where pressing Esc didn't check to see if settings needed to be reset to defaults after unchecking the boxes.
4. One or two minor tweaks to the code.

v1.0.0.9:
----------
1. Included "for Next Time" on the Save Settings menu item to make it more clearer. (Also makes it slightly longer, but there's nothing I can do about that.)
2. Added an option to avoid repeating characters. (E.g. ABBA vs. ABCA)

v1.0.0.8:
----------
1. App version now appears in the titlebar. (Eight revisions later...)
2. Changed "Settings:" to "Include:" in the main frame.
3. You can now close forms using the Escape (Esc) key.
4. Added a pointless "About" form which just includes a copy of The Unlicense text.
5. Added hotkeys for menu items (CTRL+E for Exit, CTRL+O for override, etc.) (They're mentioned next to the item in the menubar.)
6. You can now save your settings to the registry upon exit, these will be saved under: HKCU\Software\Github\Jigsy1\PassGen\
     The existence(?) of the registry entry will always be viewed as "Save Settings to Registry on Exit."
     This can be stopped either by unchecking this option in the menubar (which deletes the key), or simply by deleting the key from the registry itself.
7. Fixed a bug where automatic generation when everything was deselected would generate [empty strings].
8. Added a minor key functionality (aside from Escape):
     * Pressing Del (Delete) will now clear the password list.
     * Pressing F5 (Refresh) will now generate new passwords.
9. Other minor changes. (Uniform button width, etc.)

v1.0.0.7:
----------
1. Clarified what Uppercase characters and Lowercase characters are for those who aren't "tech savvy."
2. I noticed that having just specials enabled and one special character didn't offer any variety, so you now need a minimum of two special characters enabled.

v1.0.0.6:
----------
1. Increased randomness parameters.
2. Although nobody asked, increased PIM from 2048 to 8192. (The default is still 1024.)
3. Two minor tweaks to the code.

v1.0.0.5:
----------
1. Noticed I forgot to include a "Minimize" button on the main form. (Either that or I accidentally unset it.)
2. Re-arranged the special characters form so that the ordering is based on the ASCII table standard. !, ", #, etc.
3. Also clarified a few other characters on the same form.
4. Increased randomness parameters.
5. Tidied up the code. (Condensed, etc.)

v1.0.0.4:
----------
1. Added error checking to the Copy command since trying to copy 1,024 512 character passwords caused it to crash on Windows 8.1 (and possibly other OS'.)
     Oddly enough, it works perfectly fine on my Windows XP Virtual Machine. *shrug*
2. Added an option to include a random PIM (number) at the end of a password for those who use VeraCrypt. This will appear like: <password> -------- <N>
     This will only be included if the password is between 8 and 64 characters. Anything longer than that will be ignored.
     The choices are between 1->128, 1->256, 1->512, 1->1024, 1->2048. Anything above that is overkill, but I will include slightly above that if anyone
     requests it. (Not set as default.)

v1.0.0.3:
----------
1. Fixed a (possible) bug where Rand was only returning passwords up to 63 characters instead of 64.
2. I remembered one the applications I use has a max password of 80 characters. Rather than keep updating this every so often
     in order to update the max length, I've added settings that allow you to override the maximum length of the password generated.
     In the Menubar via a new option called "Settings," you can call the "Override" form where you can do this.
     You can choose up to 128, 256 or 512 characters. (Not set as default.)
3. In the same form, I've added an option for "increased randomness." (Not set as default incase it's "too random." E.g. mostly special characters.)
4. Even though these are the only two with Tool Tips specifically for this reason, I decided to update the special character
     selection form to help clarify "Minus" and "Period" better.

v1.0.0.2:
----------
1. Noticed I forgot to include & in Close for ALT+C functionality, so added that.
2. Added a separate form to allow you to choose what special characters you want to include.
3. Tidied up the form so everything is aligned correctly.
4. Added a menu with an option to exit the program.
5. Other minor changes not worth mentioning.

v1.0.0.1:
----------
1. Rephrased settings.
2. Included an option to include spaces in passwords. (Not set as default.)
3. Included an option to automatically (re-)generate new passwords every 60s. (Not set as default.)
4. Added a "Select All" button for easier copying.

v1.0.0:
----------
1. Initial release.
